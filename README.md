## Introduction
The Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS) provides a comprehensive dataset for analyzing trends in higher education across the United States. This report examines IPEDS data from the 2021–22 and 2022–23 academic years to explore three key questions related to institutional characteristics and enrollment trends.

First, <ins>how do schools in the West Coast Conference (WCC) and the Pac-12 compare</ins> in terms of 1-student body size, 2-retention and graduation rates, 3-endowment, and 4-tuition & fee expense. These conferences differ in institutional structure, resources, and student outcomes, offering insights into higher education dynamics.  Next, what are the <ins>trends in graduate student enrollment in Washington State</ins>, examining total enrollment shifts by sector (public vs. private, for-profit vs. non-profit), gender, and race/ethnicity. Understanding these changes helps assess higher education’s evolving landscape.  Finally, using factor analysis, we identify <ins>schools that closely match Gonzaga University in enrollment and budget</ins>. This approach provides a data-driven comparison for benchmarking and institutional insights.


## Installation

### Option 1: Access GitHub.dev (Web-Based Editor)
GitHub.dev allows you to edit code directly in your browser without needing to install anything.
