## IPEDS

**Research Question Ideas**
(from Prof. Olsen)
How do schools in the WCC compare to schools in the Pac-12 by: 
- student body size
- retention rates
- graduation rates
- endowment
- others?

How has graduate student enrollment changed in Washington State schools
- total enrollment
- by sector (public vs. private, for-profit vs. non-profit)?
- gender
- race/ethnicity 

Using factor analysis, which schools closely match Gonzaga on enrollment and budget?

(from ChatGPT)
What are the post-graduate outcomes?
- median salary of graduates from different programs within five years of graduation?

How do athletic scholarship expenditures compare between Pac-12 & WCC schools?

Can I get a 3 year trend? Data I have:
- IPEDS 2022-23 (from prof)
- IPEDS 2021-22 (from prof)
- IPEDS 2020-21 (using PowerQuery/Access to convert to .csv?)
- IPEDS 2019-20 (using PowerQuery/Access to convert to .csv?)
